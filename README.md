# Currency converter app

Here is a simple currency converter that allows you to check the current exchange rates. In the top-right corner, you can see the EUR/UAH and USD/UAH rates. In the inputs below, you can enter an amount and choose a currency with autocomplete. Values will be converted based on the current exchange rate. The values will refresh in real-time: when you change the first value, the second will also be updated, and vice versa. Enjoy!
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
